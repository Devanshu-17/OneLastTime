* The User first sends a query to the LLM.
* The LLM takes the user's query and checks it against the vector database (Qdrant) - This database will contain verified and trusted health information
* If the data is present in database, then send the response back to the user.
* If the data is not present, then using AI Agent, we will do a web search on the user's query (we will use CrewAI and SerperAPI).
* This web scraped data will be then sent to a panel of Medical experts, who will verify the data.
* This result will also be shown to the user, with a warning saying

    > :warning: **This data was taken from the web with these sources [....]**: Please wait for our Medical experts to verify the data.

* When the Medical experts verify the data, the user will be informed.
* In case, the results from the web is wrong, the the Medical Expert can send their own trusted opinion to the user.
* This final trusted and verified source will also be added to the vector database, making an ever growing set of perfect data. ðŸ¤—

## Tasks:

### PART 1: Backend Pipeline

* [x] Create a Notebook in which we will experiment AI Agents
* [x] Create a AI Agent for searching the web and summarising the scraped results
* [x] Test different prompts to verify which gives the best results
* [x] Create a Notebook to push the dataset into the database (Qdrant)
* [x] Check the threshold and FAITHFUL score of the database to ensure that the LLM can retrieve the data correctly (RAG)

### PART 2: Backend

* [x] Integrate the various pipeline into a single backend file (We will use FastAPI)
* [x] Create a MongoDB database for storing logs and Medical Expert's details.
* [x] Develop the workflow for connecting the API calls between the Medical Experts, the LLM and the users.

* [x] Email Notification Service 

### PART 3: Frontend

* [x] Create a demo frontend to show working of backend.
* [x] Create a landing page.
* [x] Create a Chat Page for user to interact with.
* [x] Create a Medical Expert page where they can validate and verify the user's query.
